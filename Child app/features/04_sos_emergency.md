## Feature 04 â€” SOS Emergency

### Overview
One-gesture SOS that alerts guardians and streams live status until resolved.

### User Stories
- As a child, I can long-press SOS to request help with a short cancel window.
- As a guardian, I receive real-time alerts and can stand down the SOS.

### UI/UX
- Screens: `MainScreen` quick SOS; `SOSScreen.tsx` full flow
- Patterns: Long-press -> confirm -> 5s cancel -> active state with live location

### Frontend Mapping
- Components: `SOSScreen`, `FloatingNotification`, `AIAlertModal` (if AI-triggered SOS)
- State: `sos: { sosId?, status: 'idle'|'active'|'cancelled'|'resolved', startedAt, lastLocation }`

### API Contracts
- POST `/api/v1/child/sos/start` -> returns sos id
- PATCH `/api/v1/child/sos/{id}/status` -> live updates
- POST `/api/v1/child/sos/{id}/cancel`
- WS `wss /child/realtime` topic `commands` -> stand down

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Child App
  participant B as Backend
  participant P as Parent App
  C->>C: Long-press then confirm then countdown
  C->>B: POST /child/sos/start with location
  B->>P: Push or WebSocket alert to guardians
  loop while active
    C->>B: PATCH /child/sos/{id}/status with location
  end
  alt Guardian resolves
    B->>C: WS command stand down
    C->>C: Exit active state
  else Child cancels within window
    C->>B: POST /child/sos/{id}/cancel
  end
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- SOS start <1s network latency target
- Live updates at configured interval until resolved
